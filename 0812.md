Wireless physical layer is safer

- data link layers not always broadcast
  - hubs to
  - switches don't
- To attackers, how is router and switches different?
  - nmap is much difficult on routers. easier on switches
- who decides how packets go
  - BGP
- end to end
  - only end to end should have packet access(L4)
  - firewall breaks this end to end
    - but aren't they encrypted? how isd L4 packet being read
