OS loads main()
Activation record.
is it something like stack?

## why is buffer overflow prevented?

- ASLR
- Stack c disabled
- `sudo sysctl -w kernel.randomize_va_space=0` to disable ASLR
-

## why do we need makefil

- recompile can be faster if we reuse unmodified parts
- otherwise it can take more than a day

## RBP should be bottom or middle of activation

- textbook says bottom
- in practice in between
- purpose: anchor that helps locate variables
