- dpdk
  - faster than all the many processes that incoming packets go through
  - difficult to write
- XDP native
- skb allocation
  - sk buffer
  - kernal object for networking
- why in real world, most packet filtering occur at higher layer?
  - tradeoff between speed and information.
  - more info avail at higher osi layer
- firewall breaks the end-to-end argument
  - prob like NAT routers
- firewall can log connectionid
  - nmap -sT completes connection -> bad
  - namap -sS doesn't complete -> good
  - nmap -sA
- Netfilter framework
- reason why rules(checks) are separated to prerouting, forward, and so on
  - to improve performance
    - esp useful for heavily used routers
- when would the input rule of firewalls would be used?
  - if somebody pings
  - when the sysadmin connect to it (ssh)

tc filter add dev ens160 ingress protocol ip flower ip_proto icmp action drop
iptables -A FORWARD -p icmp -j LOG

- why we woldn't block icmp packets to be routed at prerouting?
  - it blocks ping to the router itself
