## Mitre framework

- gonna be in quiz
- tactic technique procedure
- more granular process

## New age sources

- Mobile ad info
- bidstream auction
- happens every interval
  - if somebody captures all the bidstream, it becomes a profile of the phone owner

## scanning

- gettin initial foothold

## example scenario

- you have an initial foothold
- why is `nmap 0.0.0.0` not ok?
  - generates too much traffic, alerts admin of the system
- how about `nmap 10.*.*.*.`
  - too slow
  - so make scans as specific as possible

## Port scanning

- 0 to 1024 ports are well-known ports
- they are normally intended to be discovered

## why so many options in nmap?

- want to be stealthy as possible
- as fast as possible

## Purpose of 3way TCP handshake

- agree on sequence number, ack number
- agree on protocols to use

## reason `nmap` and `nmap -sV` answer differs

- `nmap` is a guess, less accurate
- `-sV` does actual comparison with databases
- called banner grabbing
