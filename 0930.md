## why do we use previllege escallation

- to be stealth(alter logs)
- to create persistence

## what is buffer

- memory in c

## how to overflow a buffer?

- read (overread) or write(overflow) past the allocated space
- ex) skbuf
- in RAM mostly.

### why isn't it fixed

- very slow if you do the bounds check
- software solution -> 200% slower
- hardware solution -> 140% slower

### why is it slow

- cpu overhead
  - check every bounds for ptr use
- memory overhead
  - every ptr needs to store base and bounds

## segment

- related to compilers
- data, code ,stack
- provides barrier

## how does programs think it is 2^64 gb program

- usage of virtual memory
- paging
- OS knows that the program doesn't need all
- when one program has so many page, it is called thrashing
  - (freezing and blocking of other programs)
- in practice only 48 bits are used

## why is sometimes execution result in gdb and in actual program

- gdb alters the program, by adding symbols

## why is there context save and restore within a program
